Reference
=========

*vortex* provides a complete API in both C++ and Python.
The most flexibility is available through C++, where you can either use the provided components as is or extend the *vortex* template library.
At present, the Python bindings do require several assumptions, especially regarding datatypes, but elimination of this restriction is planned.
It is expected that most will use *vortex* via its Python bindings.
